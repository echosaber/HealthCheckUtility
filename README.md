# JSS Health Check Utility

The JSS Health Check Utility is a lightweight tool for JSS administrators to run inside of their environments to perform automated health checks. It performs checks for things that commonly appear during scheduled health checks, like having too little RAM, expiring items, bad scripts, etc. Simply provide the tool the JSS URL, Username, and Password. The tool will perform API GETs to the JSS, get the JSS Summary, as well as run some commands on the system, and then display a report to the end user. Nothing is ever edited, only read. The goal of this tool is to help administrators identify issues with their environment before the issues arise.
**This tool is provided "AS IS", therefore no support from JAMF Software is guaranteed.**

## Getting Started

The latest release will always be available in the "Releases" button above. (See screenshot)

The tool runs cross platform on Mac, Windows and headless Linux, with the Linux version using a text interface. It requires Java 7+. There is a single binary that runs across all platforms. A configuration XML file is read by the tool to find values to use in health calculation. The configuration file available for download in the releases tab contains general data, but it can be easily tweaked for your specific environment. Simply point the tool to the path to this file, on first run, and then everything is complete. (If the xml file is in the same directory as the jar, it will auto-discover the xml file). 

### Downloading and Running

* Grab (Download) the latest release of the healthcheck.jar as well as the config.xml. (Chrome may warn you that this .jar file may harm your computer, but this can be ignored. The tool never writes anything to either the system, or server.) 
* If you are Windows or Mac OS X simply double click the tool to open it. (If you have gatekeeper enabled, you may have to right click the .jar file, then select "Open")
* If you are running Linux, or would like more debugging available, run the tool with this command:

```
java -jar healthcheck.jar
```

Everything generated by the tool can be outputted by starting it with this command: 

```
java -jar healthcheck.jar > output.txt
```

If you would like to run the headless, text only version on OS X or Windows run the program with the -h flag:

```
java -jar healthcheck.jar -h
```

* Provide a JSS URL and user account that has, at least, full read permissions.
* Click "Begin Health Check"!

## What does the tool check for?
- **Below data is pulled from the system, and will only be accurate if ran on the server**
- The amount of free/max memory and the amount of free/max space on disk
- **Below data is pulled from the JSS Summary**
- Web App Directory, Java Vendor, Database size and large SQL Tables
- Password Strength, Clustering and Activation Code Expiration
- Change Management Info, Tomcat Info, Log Flushing Settings and Login/Logout Hook Info
- Checks for mismatching database tables
- OS, Java, and Tomcat Version
- **Below data is pulled from the JSS API**
- GETs Activation code to be displayed in the interface
- GETs the computer Check-In frequency and ensures it is not too high for the environment size
- GETs LDAP Server Information to Display 
- GETs GSX and Managed Preference profile information and checks if it is being used
- GETs Computer, Mobile and User group information and warns of high criteria count or nested smart groups
- GETs VPP Accounts and checks for expiring tokens
- GETs all of the scripts, and checks for the old binary version or several other unsafe commands
- GETs printer information, and warns if the printer has a large driver package
- GETs Mobile and Computer Extension Attributes and warns if there are a large number of them
- GETs Network Segments and the SMTP server to display to the user
- GETs all policies, and checks for policies that contain an update inventory with recurring checkin enabled

After all of this data is pulled, the tool will parse the data, and display important items to the end user. The items that relate to the system are not displayed with cloud hosted JSSs.
