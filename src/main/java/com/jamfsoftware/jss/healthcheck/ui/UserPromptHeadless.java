/*
* UserPromptHeadless.java - Written 1/2016 by Jacob Schultz
* This class handles taking input from the user in the text based or headless interface.
* It prompts for the JSS Username, Password and URL as well as the MySQL information.
* It is designed to run on linux servers, but also is supported on Mac and Windows.
* The tool will run against a cloud JSS, but it is not recommenced, as the system checks will not be accurate.
